# Mail Scripts

These are some simple perl scripts I use to monitor the activity of my mail
server, sendmail running on Fedora Linux.

As they require access to system logs, most need to be run as root. I generally
use sudo.

These are old code that occasionally gets tweaked to handle changes in logfile
formats or mailserver changes.
